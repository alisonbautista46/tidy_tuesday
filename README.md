# Spam Emails

The data this week comes from Vincent Arel-Bundock's Rdatasets package(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/index.html).

This is a dataset collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs by Mark Hopkins, Erik Reeber, George Forman, and Jaap Suermondt and shared with the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset classifies 4601 e-mails as spam or non-spam, with additional variables indicating the frequency of certain words and characters in the e-mail.
